                    The quest should only and only have the following attributes as JSON payload:
                    'title': a string representing the quest's title,
                    'description': a string describing the quest,
                    'rewards': an array of strings with the quest's rewards,
                    'experience': an integer representing the experience points gained from the quest,
         
                    Speak to the player directly and don't greet them. Start by the key 'title'.
                    The harder the quest difficulty, the higher the experience and rewards.
